## Using this skeleton (remove this section after you have completed these steps)

This repo contains a skelton to easily create Nova Tool packages. It contains a few niceties not present in the default Nova Tool scaffolding.

First clone this repo to your development machine and remove the `.git` directory. Next run `git init` to create another repo. Create a new repo on GitHub (or another source control saas) and point the origin remote of your cloned repo to the one you just created. Here's an example: `git remote add origin git@github.com:spatie/newly-created-repo.git`. Commit all files and push to master.

Next replace these variables in all files of your repo:
 - `:author_name` (example: 'Freek Van der Herten')
 - `:author_username` (example: 'freekmurze')
 - `:author_email` (example: 'freek@spatie.be')
 - `:package_name` (example: 'nova-tail-tool')
 - `:package_description` (example: 'A tool to tail the log')
 - `:vendor` (example: 'spatie')
 - `:namespace_vendor` (example: 'Spatie')
 - `:namespace_tool_name` (example: 'TailTool')
 
 Next run `composer install`, `yarn` and `yarn production`.
 
If you don't have a Nova app already head over the [nova installation instructions](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/1.0/installation.html#installing-nova).

To use your customized package in a Nova app, add this line in the `require` section of the `composer.json` file:
 
 ```
    ":vendor/:package_name": "*",
```
 
 In the same `composer.json` file add a `repositiories` section with the path to your package repo:
 
 ```
     "repositories": [
         {
             "type": "path",
             "url": "../:package_name"
         },
```
 
Now you're ready to develop your package inside a Nova app.
 
**When you are done with the steps above delete everything above!**

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two.

Add a screenshot of the tool here.

## Installation

You can install the package in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require :vendor/:package_name
```

Next up, you must register the tool with Nova. This is typically done in the `tools` method of the `NovaServiceProvider`.

```php
// in app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php

// ...

public function tools()
{
    return [
        // ...
        new \:namespace_vendor\:namespace_tool_name\Tool(),
    ];
}
```

## Usage

Click on the ":package_name" menu item in your Nova app to see the tool provided by this package.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
